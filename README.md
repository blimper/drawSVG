# asst1_drawsvg_win
The win32 version of assignment 1 for CMU 15-462/662 : Computer Graphics<br>

The original version of this assignment is https://github.com/462cmu/asst1_drawsvg. This version just transplants the code to windows platform.<br>

Just open "drawsvg.sln" in Visual Studio 2013.

If there is a error message saying "can't find 'glew32.dll'", then just copy glew32.dll and glew32d.dll under the "lib" folder into this folder: C:\Windows\SysWOW64
